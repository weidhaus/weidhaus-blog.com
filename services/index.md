Hi there, I'm Constantin,

IT Specialist, husband and always hungry

A Tech Enthusiast, Google Certified Professional Workspace Administrator, and Certified Cloud DevOps Engineer based in Berlin.

Some of the things I love most are spending evenings with friends, engaging in deep conversations, trying new foods, and exploring the latest tech.

But above all, I cherish time with my family and poodle. One of my favorite memories is an evening in Istanbul with my wife. We dined in an alleyway under a canopy of lights in wine bottles, savouring incredible dishes.

It's these simple, yet profound experiences that I hold dear.When I'm not working, you'll find us exploring new caf√©s in Berlin, taking long walks with our dog, or trying out the latest restaurant on our ever-growing list. Food is not just sustenance for me; it's always on my mind.

My passion doesn't end with culinary experiences. As a tech enthusiast, I'm constantly immersed in the latest gadgets and innovations. Whether it's tinkering with a smart home device or exploring the potential of AI, I relish the challenge of understanding and mastering new technologies. One of my recent projects was creating an automation tool for my poodle's Instagram account, making it a quirky yet fun venture!

Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that emerging technologies bring, not just in the field of smart living but in improving everyday life.

I'm always open to discussing technology, food, and life's simple pleasures. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me an email. I'd love to hear about your favorite tech tools or must-visit spots in Berlin!
